# Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy describes what personal information we collect and how we use it.

## Information Collection and Use

The URL shortener app (get.fyn.link) does not collect any personal information, such as names, email addresses, or any other identifiable data.

When a URL is shortened using the app, the original URL is processed to generate a short URL. The short URL is stored as a hashed value, and the target URL is encrypted using a key derived from the actual short URL. This process is designed to maintain the privacy and security of the URL shortening service.

## Data Security

The hashed short URLs and encrypted target URLs are stored securely and are not accessible to unauthorized parties. The encryption key derivation process is designed to ensure the security of the stored data.

## Advertising, Tracking, and Cookies

The URL shortener app does not include any advertising, tracking mechanisms, or cookies. We do not track user activity or behavior.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact us at [privacy@get.fyn.link](mailto:privacy@get.fyn.link).

This privacy policy is subject to change without notice.
